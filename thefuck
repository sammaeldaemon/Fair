You think this is funny? That my life is a bunch of source code to play with?
Maybe you're testing and I got to be a lucky subject but just a note. Don't tell me
I have no cell phone number or service and I turn off bluetooth, NFC, 2g, 3g, 4g etc, wifi,
turn on airplane mode and yet I'm still doing things that the endless popups are telling me
won't work. Not very subtle. My life is trash though, surveil away. Impressive dedication.
